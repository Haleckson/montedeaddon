-- LibItemDB-1.0
-- A standalone, offline item database for World of Warcraft: resolve a name to
-- an item link / id (and back), read item level + stats, filter by type /
-- subtype / stat, and resolve random-suffix variants ("<base> of the Eagle")
-- — all without the item being in the client cache.
--
-- WoW ships no searchable item table and no name->item API. The data is built
-- offline from the client's DB2 tables (wago.tools) and shipped as static Lua.
--
-- Storage is split so language-independent bulk loads ONCE:
--   * core  — Data/<game>/_core/<Class>.lua, guarded by game version only.
--             quality, subclass, equip slot, item level, stats. Identical in
--             every locale, so it is shipped and parsed a single time.
--   * names — Data/<game>/<locale>/<Class>.lua, guarded by GetLocale(). Just
--             the localized item name. Only the active locale's files load.
--   * randomProps — positive ItemRandomProperties IDs (item-link field 8, e.g.
--             "item:15218::::::1196" = Crystal Sword of the Bear). Each ID is
--             one suffix family at one fixed magnitude tier; names + stat lines
--             are localized, so these ship per-locale (small: ~2k rows).
--
-- Usage (any addon):
--   local DB = LibStub("LibItemDB-1.0", true)
--   if DB and DB:IsReady() then
--       local link  = DB:GetLink(19019)            -- Thunderfury link

--       for _, r in ipairs(DB:Search({ classID = 4, stat = "STRENGTH" })) do ... end

--   * This is NOT GetItemInfo's sellPrice (what a vendor pays you). Opposite direction.
--   * It is the BASE price — what a NEUTRAL player pays. Reputation discounts are
--     applied server-side at purchase, so a player at Honored pays less than this and
--     the client is never told the discount. Label it accordingly, or don't show it.
--   * nil means "we have NO VENDOR RECORD for this item" — it is NOT proof that no vendor
--     sells it. The gate is an emulator npc_vendor dump from a LATER expansion (Wrath /
--     Cata), so an item sold only by a Vanilla- or TBC-era vendor the dump does not carry
--     is absent while a vendor really does sell it. Absence also covers a BuyPrice of 0
--     and an id this version does not ship. Do not build a "not sold by vendors" label on
--     top of nil.
-- Unlike GetRequiredLevel, nil is NOT distinguished from "unknown item": both answer nil.
-- There is no third state to represent — 0 is unreachable by construction at two
-- independent layers (build-vendor-prices.py requires bp > 0, and LoadVendorPrices rejects
-- 0/negative/non-numeric), so unlike GetRequiredLevel's 0 there is no meaningful domain
-- value to distinguish from "no data". Use HasItem(id) if you need to tell them apart.

-- What a vendor PAYS YOU for the item, in copper, or nil if it has no sell value.
--
-- The opposite direction to GetVendorBasePrice, and roughly 4x smaller — never substitute
-- one for the other. Three things worth knowing:
--   * GetItemInfo's 11th return is the same number, but ONLY for an item the client has
--     cached; it is nil otherwise and forces a GET_ITEM_INFO_RECEIVED retry loop. This is
--     always populated. Same rationale as GetRequiredLevel.
--   * nil here is a CLEAN statement, unlike GetVendorBasePrice's: the item has no sell
--     value (a quest item, a token). There is no vendor gate to muddy it.
--   * NO reputation discount is applied. Faction discounts are believed to be BUY-side
--     only — the sources define a faction discount in terms of buying, and say nothing
--     about selling — but that is NOT verified, and no client-side source can settle it:
--     the mechanic is entirely server-side (no flavour's client carries any discount
--     arithmetic). If it turns out selling is affected too, this number is the Neutral

-- real per-hit `ch`% × triggering hits/sec. Capped by any internal cooldown. Value
-- per bucket: buff = magnitude × uptime ×
-- weight (uptime = min(stacks, rate×dur)); damage = bonus DPS × the weapon-DPS weight
-- (per hand, self-calibrating melee/ranged — see below); heal = HPS →
-- healing-power-equivalent × healing weight (model.epPerHPS = healing
-- power per HPS); mana = mana/sec → mp5 × weight. No burst premium — a proc isn't
-- player-controlled. hitsPerSec comes from the paperdoll (opts.attack) or the model.
--
-- SCOPE AND RATE ARE DIFFERENT QUESTIONS, and only rows with `sc="spell"` care -- finding 9.
-- A paperdoll can only ever report WEAPON SWINGS, so once a consumer wires opts.attack (the
-- documented intent) a swing rate would start driving procs that fire on a CAST: Vestments of
-- Faith's 8-piece (Sets.lua:158) triggers on a priest's spells and would move with the speed of
-- whatever they happen to be holding. So a spell-scoped row is priced off `model.castsPerSec`
-- when the flavour declares one, and off `model.hitsPerSec` -- the per-class MODEL default,
-- never the paperdoll value -- when it does not.
--
-- WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: pick a cast rate. No shipped rules module declares
-- `castsPerSec`, so every score today is bit-identical to before this change (model.hitsPerSec
-- is exactly what the callers already resolved when no paperdoll is wired). What changes is that
-- a paperdoll can no longer reach a spell-scoped row. The VALUE is still the open half of
-- finding 9 and is a question for the owner; inventing one here is the failure this repo names.

-- gear is worth, which is what makes a "gear vs. buffs vs. talents" comparison honest.

-- while the weight scales speak ITEM_MOD_POWER_REGEN0_SHORT / ITEM_MOD_SPELL_DAMAGE_DONE,
-- with zero overlap. The alias fold that bridges them is private to the expansion's rules

-- every mp5 and spell-power consumable at exactly 0 — silently, and differently per flavour.
