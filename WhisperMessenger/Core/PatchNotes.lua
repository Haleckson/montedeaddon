"Now works on World of Warcraft: Forever (beta). Mythic+ features stay off there.",
'New "Pandaria" theme: dark charcoal with jade-green accents (pairs well with EllesmereUI).',
"Fresh modern look for every theme, including Azeroth:\n   - Cleaner window: no more boxes inside boxes, a soft shadow, and thin crisp lines.\n   - Matching line icons in the title bar, a centered window title, a paper-plane Send button, and smooth hover fades.\n   - Softer highlight on the selected contact; pin and remove buttons only appear on hover.\n   - Compact contact rows and a slimmer message area, so more fits on screen.\n   - Unread count circles all match the theme color and look smooth.\n   - Whispers / Groups switch is now a footer tab bar.\n   - Messages fade softly at the top and bottom of the chat as you scroll.\n   - For a game-style frame, turn on the Native WoW HUD option.",
'Writing messages:\n   - Each chat keeps its own half-typed message, even after a reload. It no longer follows you to the next contact, and the contact list shows a red "Draft:".\n   - Reply to a message: right-click a whisper and pick "Reply". Friends who use WhisperMessenger see the quoted line too.\n   - Quick replies: a new button next to the emoji button drops in a saved reply like "On my way". Edit your list (up to 10) under Options > Behavior.\n   - Messages that didn\'t go out now show "(Queued)" or "(Not sent)" next to the time. Click it to send, retry or discard.\n   - Pressed Send just as whispers got paused (Mythic+, boss fight, arena, battleground)? Your message now waits as "Queued" instead of being lost. Nothing is sent until you click.',
'Contacts:\n   - Right-click a contact to mute them, give them a nickname, add a private note, or get told when they come online. These options now sit under their own gold "WhisperMessenger" heading.\n   - Muted chats stay silent: no sound, popup or taskbar flash, and their unread count turns grey.\n   - Nicknames show instead of the real name, and notes show at the top of the chat. Contact search finds both.\n   - Offline contacts now show when they were last online, for example "Last online 2h".\n   - Requests (optional): turn it on under Options > Behavior, and whispers from strangers wait quietly in a new Requests tab until you accept or delete them.\n   - Dragging a pinned contact shows a card under your pointer and a line where it will land.',
'Reading:\n   - A "New messages" line marks where your unread messages start. Long backlogs open at that line.\n   - A new "Mark all as read" button in the top-left corner clears every unread count at once.\n   - Group chats highlight messages that mention your name and show an "@" on the chat.\n   - A welcome message shows when no chat is open, and the Groups tab explains where party, raid, instance and guild chats show up.\n   - Custom channels show just their name (like "CraftScan") without the channel number.',
'Native WoW HUD option now looks like the game all the way through:\n   - A standard search box, game-style Whispers / Groups tabs, a classic message box, and red-gold buttons.\n   - The "Start a new conversation" and copy-message popups use the game\'s standard dialog look.\n   - Cleaner layout: no empty strip above the chat, one even background behind both sides, and the full addon name in the title.',
"Refreshed settings: simple page list, on/off switches, slim sliders and cleaner choice buttons.",
'The "(Invite to WM)" link is now gold and translated into every supported language.',
"Hovering the WhisperMessenger button or minimap icon shows the key that opens the messenger.",
"What's New: the button now pulses with the same soft glow as the WhisperMessenger button and minimap icon, and the page puts a thin line between changes so it's easier to scan.",
"Fixed: new whispers flash the taskbar icon again while you're tabbed out, even with whispers hidden from normal chat. You can turn this off under Options > Notifications.",
"Fixed: the message box stopped one letter short of a full-length whisper.",
"Fixed: old chats weren't removed by your Message Retention setting while the window was open.",
'Fixed: contacts you had whispered could stay "Online" after they logged off.',
"Fixed: whispering an offline guildmate showed a blank contact with no class, race or portrait.",
"Fixed: the unread count on a contact pressed against the edge of the list.",
"Fixed: a channel post shown in a whisper chat vanished after a reload.",
"Fixed: reloading while in a group started a second group chat.",
"Fixed: long button names in settings touched the button edges.",
